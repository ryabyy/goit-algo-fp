**Goal:** Calculate the sum of outcomes of two dice rolling with the Monte Carlo method, simulating the outcomes many times, compare to analytical results.

**Algorithms used:**
- _Monte Carlo method_

**Results:**
After performing the analysis, it can be easily seen that the Monte Carlo method of random dice rolling simulations converges to the analytical expectations with increasing the number of draws.
It is worth noting, that on a modern computer with this algorithm one can easily draw 100000 times, which runs almost immediately and results in correct percentages. As for the decimals in this case, first one usually is close, may be a bit off.
Increasing the number of draws to one million or beyond is going to fix the values of the first decimals more in place and make the numbers be closer to the analytical expectations.
